1	4e7b352b4bd5046c04000000	petition	Stop Animal Homelessness at Its Roots	" Every year in the United States, an estimated 6 to 8 million lost, abandoned, or unwanted dogs and cats enter animal shelters and nearly half of these animals‰ÛÓmany of them healthy, young, and adoptable‰ÛÓmust be euthanized because there are too many animals and not enough good homes.   This tragedy occurs because people don't spay and neuter their animals and because greedy breeders continue to churn out more puppies. Because all dogs and cats are precious and because no more animals need to be bred when so many others go without hope of being adopted, PETA is calling for a mandatory spay-and-neuter law until all dogs and cats in the United States have a home to call their own.   Sign the petition calling for a mandatory spay-and-neuter law to help end the animal overpopulation crisis.

"The elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive the plurality of the nationwide popular vote - that is, the American people did not get the President democracy should have selected.  Due to the way electoral votes are allocated, candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaigns on ""swing"" states with many voters, such as Florida, and neglect states such as Texas which do not swing.   Due to necessary rounding errors when allocating votes, members of a sparsely populated state effectively accrue more voting power than members of a well-populated state.  This increases the electoral power of members of certain states while reducing it for others on an ongoing basis.  We beg our leaders to dissolve this system and let us vote."	5000	29311	0	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/grant-voters-ability-vote-president-united-states-dissolving-electoral-college	30	Reviewed	1316698213	32	2514	3855	1472	983	1122	736	504	382	272	240	251	316	256	177	163	68	221	203	163	148	129	114	75	58	253	272	205	462	305	121	65	80	73	370	231	122	327	185	315	376	123	135	141	77	68	304	529	109	66	50	34	49	56	91	256	138	191	115	71	1	20819

Marijuana prohibition in particular is a colossal waste of resources that could be put to better use. Taking a noncriminal, regulatory approach to marijuana would enable states to pass their own laws, regulations and taxes to control marijuana and would end the Justice Department's intimidation tactics in medical marijuana states. One or more states will likely legalize adult use of marijuana in 2012, and the Obama administration should stop wasting scarce federal resources and uphold the president‰Ûªs campaign pledge to respect states‰Ûª rights when it comes to marijuana."	5000	17054	0	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/stop-interfering-state-marijuana-legalization-efforts	30	Reviewed	1316709859	4713	2780	1539	1043	764	609	431	347	312	195	152	291	236	268	212	133	96	198	130	93	119	137	178	79	64	369	279	212	267	267	115	60	76	60	158	66	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	17054

Despite being born to American fathers, these children can‰Ûªt come to America and reunite with them, because of Public Law 97-359; Amerasians from these countries cannot take advantage of Public Law 97-359 or other existing provisions of law.   These children have American blood, they should be American citizens. I urge you to pass legislation to grant US citizenship to America‰Ûªs forgotten children from Japan and The Philippines.  This legislation would grant US citizenship to children born out of wedlock to American citizen fathers (mostly military men) with foreign women overseas.

"The Glass‰ÛÒSteagall Act kept our country depression free for over 70 years. By maintaining a separation between investment and banking, it allowed banks to effectively serve their clients needs, instead of their own.   It was not until 1999, and the creation of the Gramm‰ÛÒLeach‰ÛÒBliley Act, that the separation was broken. Within those 12 years, our country has experienced a dot-com bubble and a large financial crisis. Both of these situations where created by commercial banks investing their large quantities of consumer money into speculations. I urge you, President Barack Obama, to bring back sound investment to the United States by re-instating a separation between investment banks and banking.

Ethanol as a biofuel is less desirable because its energy content is 25% less than unleaded gasoline, and it is corrosive to engines because it absorbs water.

No corporation should be allowed to give campaign contributions to any politician or political party that is involved in writing or voting on legislation that affects them or the industry they profit from.  In any other scenario giving money to people who are supposed to be regulating something you are doing is considered bribery.  If a sports team gives money to the referee before their game - its a bribe.  If a defendant gives money to a judge or jury member before his trial - its a bribe.  If a criminal gives money to a police officer - its a bribe.  Politics should be no different.  Corporations giving millions of dollars to politicians could not create a more clear conflict of interest in policy making - ITS A BRIBE.

It makes as much sense to teach creationism in a science class as it would to teach that the sun rotates around the earth in an astronomy class, or that lightning and storms are created by the the gods in a weather science lecture.  Evolutionary theory is the basis for much of modern biology, and to accept creationism is to reject modern knowledge of geology, carbon dating, genetics, and history.

"Often in American politics, we find ourselves in an absurd position of voting for someone we dislike to keep someone we hate out of office.  Instant run-off voting is the first step to solving this issue.  It allows for candidates to be ranked according to preference, and at each step the candidate with the lowest votes is eliminated until a clear majority is attained.  This will make third parties a viable option in the US.  Because you're not faced with having to play game theory in order to get a good result.  No long will a vote for Nader be a vote for Bush.
