This tragedy occurs because people don't spay and neuter their animals and because greedy breeders continue to churn out more puppies. Because all dogs and cats are precious and because no more animals need to be bred when so many others go without hope of being adopted, PETA is calling for a mandatory spay-and-neuter law until all dogs and cats in the United States have a home to call their own.   Sign the petition calling for a mandatory spay-and-neuter law to help end the animal overpopulation crisis.

"The elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive the plurality of the nationwide popular vote - that is, the American people did not get the President democracy should have selected.  Due to the way electoral votes are allocated, candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaigns on ""swing"" states with many voters, such as Florida, and neglect states such as Texas which do not swing.   Due to necessary rounding errors when allocating votes, members of a sparsely populated state effectively accrue more voting power than members of a well-populated state.  This increases the electoral power of members of certain states while reducing it for others on an ongoing basis.

These children have American blood, they should be American citizens. I urge you to pass legislation to grant US citizenship to America‰Ûªs forgotten children from Japan and The Philippines.  This legislation would grant US citizenship to children born out of wedlock to American citizen fathers (mostly military men) with foreign women overseas.

"The Glass‰ÛÒSteagall Act kept our country depression free for over 70 years. By maintaining a separation between investment and banking, it allowed banks to effectively serve their clients needs, instead of their own.   It was not until 1999, and the creation of the Gramm‰ÛÒLeach‰ÛÒBliley Act, that the separation was broken. Within those 12 years, our country has experienced a dot-com bubble and a large financial crisis. Both of these situations where created by commercial banks investing their large quantities of consumer money into speculations. I urge you, President Barack Obama, to bring back sound investment to the United States by re-instating a separation between investment banks and banking.

If a sports team gives money to the referee before their game - its a bribe.  If a defendant gives money to a judge or jury member before his trial - its a bribe.  If a criminal gives money to a police officer - its a bribe.  Politics should be no different.  Corporations giving millions of dollars to politicians could not create a more clear conflict of interest in policy making - ITS A BRIBE.

Nine years locked up more than meet the requirements of most any State. A similar offense in California would have netted a person less than a year.

They are inhumane, expensive and dangerous to humans."	" The term euthanasia is from the Greek meaning ""good death.""  Carbon monoxide gas chambers are definitely not a ""good death"", as animals slowly suffocate to death, sometimes taking 45 minutes and multiple gassings in order to die. Animals cry, bite one another, and bleed out of their cavities, all while fully conscious. Although some states have already banned the use of these cruel chambers, this archaic practice should be banned on a national level. It is inhumane, more expensive than Pentobarbital injection and most importantly, dangerous to shelter workers.

Our traveling exhibit showcases the stories and photographs of these heroes who have saved, and improved, the quality of life for countless others. We hope reading these short stories allow families to discuss the need for organ donation. We believe the White House can continue to show support for the cause by honoring every day heroes who said ‰ÛÏYES‰Ûù to donation by allowing the Organ Donor Hall of Fame exhibit to be displayed in the White House during April 2012, Donate Life month. vvv "	25000	257	24743	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/allow-organ-donor-hall-fame-exhibit-be-displayed-white-house-during-april-2012-donate-life	30	Closed	1320767802	79	20	18	1	1	6	4	5	6	8	20	20	5	9	1	5	5	1	7	3	4	2	7	9	4	0	1	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2571381	4eb94f3a53b2cf7112000054	petition	"Keep the Air National Guard Bands that are scheduled to be cut on Oct 1, 2013."	"The Air National Guard band program currently features 11 bands around the country.  However, due to recent budget cuts, 6 of these bands will be shut down no later than 1 Oct 2013.  The National Guard has worked alongside their active duty counterparts in deploying these bands to warzones to entertain troops, and one of the groups among those to be cut, Sidewinder, has earned the Guard nationwide recognition and news coverage through their efforts overseas. Forcing cuts on these bands, which have traditionally served as the military's goodwill ambassadors, is not an appropriate solution to the military's budget problems. These issues do need to be addressed, but not at the expense of our troops' morale."	25000	814	24186	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/keep-air-national-guard-bands-are-scheduled-be-cut-oct-1-2013	30	Closed	1320771729	242	149	48	21	12	48	49	62	14	10	8	6	18	25	7	3	1	3	11	10	14	18	7	9	8	3	2	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	8141386	4eb9867653b2cffe100000a6	petition	Legalize Mixed Martial Arts in New York	We are petitioning the Legalization of Mixed Martial Arts in New York.

"It has been nearly 20 years since the laws and regulations governing broadcast television have been updated.  Since that time, the way Americans consume and view television has changed dramatically.  Even though technical barriers have been eliminated, consumers remain trapped by artificially drawn geographic boundaries that give broadcast stations monopoly powers over network and syndicated programming in their respective markets.   This government constructed marketplace has stifled competition and innovation, limited consumer choice, led to threatened and actual blackouts of must-have programming, and dramatically driven up the cable and satellite rates.  We urge the Obama Administration to initiate a process to update this outdated regime.

In light of failure of the Udall Amendment , and the likely passage of the bill in the Senate, we urge the president to exercise his authority to veto the National Defense Authorization Act."	25000	19318	5682	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/veto-national-defense-authorization-act-2012-several-provisions-bill-pose-threat-civil	30	Closed	1322675206	61	123	650	561	497	574	1458	2514	1854	932	603	345	508	597	703	1196	623	259	828	663	544	277	238	152	79	56	344	655	536	883	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	193181566	4ed675e32ee8d0b55d000013	petition	"Investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena as Reported by Citizens, Police, Astronauts, Pilots and the Military."	"Searching for microbes on Mars and radio signals from space is not enough. We must explain Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, or UAP, right here on Earth.  For six decades worldwide, credible witnesses (including Presidents Carter and Reagan) have consistently described objects with flight capabilities beyond our technology. UAP are often verified by radar and even seen at nuclear sites by military officers.   Given the national security implications, the United States should conduct an independent investigation. This inquiry must transparently review the key unsolved UAP reports with access to classified documents. It must have the power to call witnesses and grant immunity.

Keep your State of the Union promise: Increase the funding for research to find a cure for childhood cancers. Basic research into the leading fatal disease among children is likely to lead to new discoveries that help treat or prevent other types of adult cancer. If this great nation can find a cure, it will help the thousands of families that lose a child to this horrible disease.

Please also remind Saakashvili that he came to power 8 years ago because of public outrage at fraudulent elections, and that fact alone puts upon his shoulders the moral responsibility to ensure that the parliamentary elections to be held later this year will be more free and fair than any which had preceded them.

"I believe that we need to remove the words ""  one nation under God "" from the Pledge of Allegiance and go back to using the 1924-1954 version of the Pledge of Allegiance which is:  "" I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all.""    I think, with the religious neutrality of the U.S. government, we should not have any reference to a deity or religion in i.e. our motto's, our pledges, or anything else. This gives the idea that our government favors the christian religion, even though our government claims to be neutral in religion. Many people may possibly find this reference to the christian God offensive, therefore I think it needs to be removed.

We feel that ending official discrimination sets an example for others."	25000	950	24050	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/be-made-aware-and-take-direct-action-prevent-official-discrimination-towards-atheists	30	Closed	1329834418	148	64	134	66	29	26	29	22	27	22	24	19	58	58	20	28	19	20	3	22	45	22	12	6	3	4	5	5	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	9502021	4f445498709f038433000044	petition	Place a moratorium on states from placing residency restrictions on registered sex offenders who've finished their time.	"The State of Kansas, in 2005, considered allowing their municipalities to create residency restrictions for registered sex offenders.  In weighing their decision they considered what the experts on a national level have stated about such restrictions - that they are counterproductive to public safety - and they instead placed a moratorium preventing any municipality from creating such restrictions.  It is in the best interests of our country to follow this lead and follow the advice of the Human Rights Watch in their 146-page report titled ""US: Sex Offender Laws May Do More Harm Than Good"" and create a national moratorium to prevent states from creating such residency restrictions."	25000	278	24722	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/place-moratorium-states-placing-residency-restrictions-registered-sex-offenders-whove	30	Closed	1329878554	32	14	4	5	4	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	4	37	14	26	12	9	29	21	8	13	9	2	7	8	3	3	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	2782026	4f45e358cf436a756f00000d	petition	immediately investigate UFO/ET Disclosure efforts during the Clinton administration - the Rockefeller Initiative.

These domestic animals are  not naturally prey animals and so have not developed natural instincts to fight the terror they experience when put into cages with wild animals to be torn apart alive.    We ask that this inhumane and unnecessary cruelty to animals be outlawed.  Live feeding as a protocol should be banned, as it in other countries.

Leading economists, government agencies, and leaders have been saying it all along: reducing the principal on homes that are worth less than their mortgages produces a positive financial benefit for homeowners, taxpayers, and the country as a whole. Ed DeMarco, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency -- which oversees Fannie and Freddie -- has stood in the way of reductions and he's claimed the support of Fannie and Freddie.

Currently, 16 states and Washington D.C. have legalized the use of medical marijuana, and hemp products are sold widely in the U.S. today.  The problem with leaving this up to the states is that some citizens may never be given the freedom.  Cannabis could be rescheduled either legislatively, through Congress, or through the executive branch.

Military recruiters are a common sight in our high schools, and they often make unwanted contact with our young people via phone calls and social media, trying ultimately to woo these kids into a combat zone. This has been going on for years, but why on earth is it allowed?  It shouldn't be.  As a society, we have determined that minors aren't yet ready to drink, smoke, vote, get married, and so on, but somehow it is okay to try to hard-sell them into a situation where they could be killed or be forced to kill?

"We petition the Obama Administration to issue an Executive Order immediately halting deportations. They have become a significant aspect of America's unofficial, escalating war on poor and displaced people who have no meaningful legal status anywhere. We make this petition out of deep concern for those who live in constant fear of being taken from families without warning, for the irreparable, traumatizing effect unceasing fear and deportations necessarily cause, and because the record-high deportations of the first Obama administration is a recognizable, gross human rights violation. This is a humanitarian crisis affecting not only undocumented migrants, but their US citizen spouses, US born children, and other loved ones. Thank you for considering our petition.

He remains in captivity while the Taliban attempts to barter with America for his life in an effort to further its militant agenda.  Our goals are to: 1) raise public awareness about Bowe's captivity  2) to communicate to those U.S. Federal officials responsible for obtaining Bowe's release that the American people expect ongoing & effective action to be taken to return Bowe safely to the United States,  3) to unite together as citizens to communicate to both Bowe & his family that America is in solidarity with them during this time of crisis.

"Amendment I - US Constitution  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...""   Obamacare directly prohibits the free exercise of religion of millions of Roman Catholics, other religions, corporations and individuals by mandating direct financial support and cooperation in abortions and abortifacients.  Many Americans believe abortion is the murder of innocent human life - directly contrary to the religious teachings of most religious traditions.  We request an executive order exempting religious institutions and individual religious objectors from participation in any Obamacare mandates supporting abortion or artificial contraception directly or indirectly via insurance policies covering these abhorrent procedures.

The act is designed to ensure that all students make learning gains each year, that teachers receive training in gifted education, addresses the needs of under-served populations and promotes the development and dissemination of best practices in gifted education."	25000	3739	21261	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/support-unique-learning-needs-academically-gifted-students-passing-talent-act	30	Closed	1353069381	15	26	56	264	249	133	41	31	56	72	162	177	476	277	129	54	51	154	174	162	117	93	44	31	95	158	116	135	111	80	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	37394236	50a65004c988d4e354000007	petition	Nationalize the Twinkie industry	"We the undersigned, hereby request Barack Obama to immediately Nationalize the Twinkie industry and prevent our nation from losing her sweet creamy center."	25000	4409	20591	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/nationalize-twinkie-industry	30	Closed	1353076874	2063	838	408	324	110	35	34	19	25	23	16	28	21	18	12	8	6	8	115	93	10	27	9	9	34	33	14	34	16	19	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	44094241	50a654aacde5b84858000004	petition	Abolish the illegal federal reserve and return to a gold and silver standard as defined in the U.S constitution.

Studies have shown that areas that do not allow concealed carry have higher violent crime rates. Many of the recent mass shootings have taken place in ""gun free"" zones that do not allow concealed carry by lawful citizens.

It develops from the tissues that form the sympathetic nervous system (which controls body functions, such as heart rate & blood pressure, digestion and levels of certain hormones). It most commonly begins in the abdomen in the tissues of the adrenal gland, but it may also occur in other areas. It can spread to the lymph nodes, liver, bones & bone marrow.     Annually In the US, 650 children are diagnosed with Neuroblastoma     It is the most common tumor found in children younger than 1 year of age.  Every 16 hrs a child with Neuroblastoma dies.

"In his annual Christmas address to the College of Cardinals,  Pope Benedict XVI, the global leader of the Roman Catholic Church, demeaned and belittled homosexual people around the world. Using hateful language and discriminatory remarks, the Pope painted a portrait in which gay people are second-class global citizens. Pope Benedict said that gay people starting families are threatening to society, and that gay parents objectify and take away the dignity of children.

"Gender Dysphoria, a clinically recognized condition, affects millions of Americans. Gender Reassignment Surgery is a proven medical necessity in order to preserve the mental health, and lives, of Transgender persons.  Despite recent rulings by the Internal Revenue Service Tax Court, the 9th United States District Court and the Supreme Court of New York, the Federal Government continues to describe Gender Reassignment Surgery as ""unproven and experimental.""

Moreover, churches exist primarily for religious activities that should not be publicly subsidized."	25000	5921	19079	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/tax-religious-organizations-and-churches	30	Closed	1356815269	60	5	2	5	4	37	9	4	2	2	3	4	2	0	1	2	4	1	2	402	1727	1224	707	520	268	224	228	208	145	118	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	59215636	50df72337043011329000010	petition	There are election rigging made by Progressive Program that have been used in the 18th Presidential Election of S.

"Harness the full intellectual and industrial strength of our universities, national laboratories and private enterprise to rapidly develop and deploy a nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) adaptable to both manned and un-manned space missions. A NTR (which would only operate in outer space) will jump-start our manned space exploration program by reducing inner solar system flight times from months to weeks. This is not new technology; NTRs were tested in the 1960s (President Kennedy was a guest at one test). The physics and engineering are sound.

We have even commissioned a Preliminary Environmental Impact Report on the subject from Sacramento State University which they will not accept.  The only response received from the Commission was:  ‰ÛÏThere‰Ûªs no reason for us to legalize one more animal that could come into California and do damage to our native species‰Ûù  Yet they are unable to identify any actual damages done by domestic ferrets.

"While 1992's Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act ended the right of cable service providers to regional exclusivity, the prior existence of these monopolies created a barrier to entry for competing service providers that remains today.  The cost for potential competition to enter a market with an already established provider is prohibitive. As a result, cable service providers are permitted to provide abhorrent service at excessive and unfair prices.   By stepping in to offer competing providers an incentive to enter existing markets, or by forcing providers that control a market to share equipment with competitors, the federal government can end these natural monopolies and provide consumers with real choices.

Live trapping, especially with footholds, typically causes no harm or suffering, and has allowed many species to be successfully reintroduced to native habitats where they were previously driven out. Trapping is carefully regulated by state game agencies, preventing over-harvest or physical damage to the animals. Without medicine, animals are prone to death by disease, as well as starvation or predation, especially as populations grow; those which do survive often move into human habitats and cause damage. Trapping prevents and corrects these situations by keeping populations if check.

In dairy farms, cows are impregnated annually, only to have their babies taken from them and killed, and the milk they produce for their babies stolen and sold to humans.  And in egg ""farms,"" male chicks, who can't lay eggs, are suffocated, gassed, or macerated while alive.  FFs also cause more global warming than cars.

The motorcyclist is not to exceed 10 MPH over what the surrounding vehicles are doing. 2. The motorcyclist is not to exceed 40 MPH. 3.

This ""our wives, mothers, and daughters"" phrase is one he routinely employs, but it is counterproductive to the women's equality the President is ostensibly supporting.

Cutting Social Security benefits via Chained CPI or Superlative CPI is unacceptable to Americans. A recent National Academy of Social Insurance poll found 64% of Americans thought the COLA should be increased not cut. A poll conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health showed 66% of Americans supported no cuts to Social Security.  Increasing annual COLA's also increases Social Security Trust Fund revenues.

Research shows that children of divorce benefit greatly with the opportunity to have a fair and equal relationship with both  parents. All across our country the future and well being of our children are being put at risk from unfair parenting arrangements handed down from judges in cases that never even go to trial.

A trusting public believes the money they've donated  reaches the victims directly. But money collected by non-profits goes to support their own long-term operations and fundraising goals or is siphoned off to other non-profits.  We call for the creation of a National Compassion Fund so after every future national tragedy a centralized, trusted fund is created (i.e.. Sandy Hook National Compassion Fund) so that public-intent is fulfilled and 100% of the money raised for victims actually get to them.

We petition the Obama Administration to use its authority to stop the sequester cut to the fixed cost of cancer drugs, payment for which is specifically set by law and should not be reduced by sequestration.

In a democratic state, there is no reason why the government should refuse to do a recount when such a large portion of the population demands it.

"Horse slaughter is an inhumane industry which creates the problems it claims to solve by fostering irresponsible breeding. The FDA states horses are not raised as food animals and are treated with chemicals toxic to humans.  It poses a threat of contamination to the US food chain.  Horse slaughter is subsidized by taxpayers-USDA inspection of plants and product, tax incentives to breeders.  The sequester prompted budget cuts which poses additional threat of exporting unsafe meat to allies and unsuspecting victims.  Waste water and blood from horse slaughter are notorious for overwhelming local waste water infrastructures and poses a significant threat to the environment, especially since numerous drugs with which horses are routinely treated are not safe for humans.

In contrast, a person may deduct interest paid on home loans for up to two homes: a main home, and a vacation home. The only limitation is that the interest can only be on the first $1 million in mortgage value.

At 4:20pm numerous participants of the event engaged in a civil disobedience action where they lit up marijuana cigarettes and openly ingested cannabis.   N.A. Poe was arrested during this action and charged with impeding/assaulting/resisting police during an arrest. These charges are bogus.  As a result, we demand his immediate release from federal custody and exoneration from all charges.

Having the President of the United States give an opinion on a social issue such as this before all the facts are available is utterly damning to Zimmerman due to the weight and power that the words of the President of the United States hold.

"As of July 25th, sources confirm that the President is choosing between either Janet Yellin or Larry Summers to serve as the next Chairman of The Federal Reserve.  For a concise rundown on both of these people, see Robert Reich's post from 07/25/2013 here: https://www.facebook.com/RBReich  In short: Yellin has impeccable credentials, is currently Vice-Chair of the Fed, and is least likely to continue the crony corporatism that has infected Washington.  Summers nudged Clinton to kill Glass-Steagall, opposed regulating commodity derivatives and as chair of the National Economic Council under Obama, he and Tim Geithner, then Treasury Secretary, bailed out Wall Street while refusing to impose tough conditions on the banks.  He is said to be tied closely to Goldman Sachs.

"Larry Summers has been a disaster for the economy. During his time in Washington, Larry pushed for the deregulation of the financial industry in the 1990's. This included both pushing to end the Glass-Stegall Act as well as fighting against attempts to regulate risky financial derivatives.  Furthermore, after the 2008 financial collapse, he spearheaded the Wall Street bailout while shooting down attempts to put tough conditions on the banking industry. As a result, the Wall Street banks are now 30% larger than they were in 2008 with very little new regulation in place to stop another collapse.  America needs someone who will focus more on helping Main Street and less on Wall Street. Larry Summers is NOT that person.

"We need to put a price on carbon to sharply diminish the amount of carbon pollution in our atmosphere and encourage innovation in sustainability. Carbon dioxide is one of several heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by humans.  The scientific consensus is that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming, and that carbon dioxide is the most important of these gases. A carbon tax would be a cost effective way to hold the biggest polluters accountable for their actions, and we could use this tax to help the people impacted by the pollution the most - the poor.  A number of countries have already implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon content.

Manning, who released classified information exposing potential breaches of international humanitarian law by US forces, was sentenced in military court on Aug 21st to 35 yrs in prison.

"Most states (though not all) have laws stating that a woman is free to breastfeed her child anywhere, public or private, that she and her child are otherwise allowed to be. However, with the exception of a few states (CT, DC, NJ, VT, & WA), there exist no enforcement provisions. This means that as soon as a woman who is legally breastfeeding her child is asked by a business owner or security to leave, she is then trespassing.   Other countries (i.e. Taiwan, the UK) have fines for those who would interfere with a woman's right to breastfeed; the US should as well.  A woman should not be forced to hide, whether under a fabric cover, in the restroom, or in her car, simply because she elects to breastfeed her child.

The 14-beagle experiment is a repeated testing; is unnecessary and  very cruel, which has violated research ethics."	100000	754	99246	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/urge-taiwanese-government-cancel-animal-experiment-plan-expose-unvaccinated-beagle-puppies	47	Closed	1378059991	94	106	52	63	37	26	19	21	117	22	21	4	9	10	9	11	7	21	25	17	14	5	6	4	2	6	2	5	4	13	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	75410886	5225251f00e5791e3f000006	petition	Chinese government secret human experiments-----Require the attention of the world's people_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_Ïç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î•_Îèøá_±â_ü_ç¥Î____¡ÔŒÉ___¬	_öÔ_÷ø_ü_Œ__Œ¨äŒ__ŒÉÂ_¡Ôç_Üçã¡•_Î_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏŒÉ_Œ_«_ù´Œø__öÔŒÎÉ_ÜÂ_É¢_Û__øÕèçøŒÏ¬Œ Éç_ãç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î_«ÈŒ_¬Œø_èà«_öÔ_üäŒçÅŒ_Å_üçŒö¡Œ¡±è¢Ç_¨ÜŒ¨__öêèâùçÁÂŒÎ_Œ__ŒèÔèÄ Œ__çâ_•_ÎçÁ¨èø_ç_ãŒ_¬èãäçÁÂŒÎ_‹ÛÅ_Ç÷èÁÛŒ_Ü‹ÛÅŒÀÄèãèçÑÉ•_ÎŒ___üÓ__«_Ïäç__Œ¡ÀçÑÉ•_Îèøá_±â__ÙŒ__ç_ãç__Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏŒÕÎ____¡ÔŒÉ___¬‹Ûâ  Œø__öÔèÀ_èÁÎç_ãç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î_«ÈŒ_¬ŒÏ¬_ü_Œ__ŒèÇèãÔ___(ç__ç´____Œö_)Œ¨__»Î•_ÎçÓ±Œ__Œ¨_Œ¨äŒÉ¬_Ä¬è«Ùè«£•_ÎŒÏ¬_ü_Œ___ÏäŒ___àè_ÑÊè_ÏŒêÎèÄ__¨Ü__È______•_ÎŒÉüŒ_Üç_ã_Ïä•__ç_èŒÈ_Œê«Œá_Œ_ç•_ÎŒ´_•_Î28Œ_Å•_ÎŒèÑŒ¨_3Œ_«•_Î_¨ÜŒ¨__öêŒ_êŒ¨ÇèâÎç÷_ç_ä_üçŒÊ»__÷ç£¬èÛÎèà»_ùÛ•_____ŒÎÑŒ__ŒÉÂ___•_ÎçÓá•_Î40Œ_Å•_ÎŒèÑŒ¨_10Œ_«•_Î_¨ÜŒ¨___È___èÄ Œ__Œ£_èÉ_çªÎ‹Ûâ  _µÅ__Êç_ãèãÔ___çÏÙç_ü_÷ø•__Œö____èãÔçÓµèãÔ_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö__ÀÁ_Åø_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_èö è¨__ùÄ‹ÛÅç_©__¥Œ_Ü_ùÄ•_ö_ù___¥•_ä‹Ûâ  çä_ŒöÇŒ__è¡Äç_ã_÷øŒö____èãÔ_ùÄ•_ÎŒèøŒö _ü_•__Œö__ÄÉçÈ»_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_ŒÀÄçê _ÛùçÈ«_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_èãÔŒ_±ŒÄè_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö__ÛùçÈ«_¬ÁŒ_èŒ_¢_öê_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_è¨¡ŒÀ Œö __ê_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_çÓÙŒ_÷èÄ_Œ___ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_____Ê_Œ¡__ü´_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_ç________Œ_Û_ùÄ•_öèÀª_Ä¬Œö _Û_èÀàçÉ_Œ_¬ç_____èÀÇŒ¨_Œè_Œ_Ñ___Œö_•_ä•__Œö_ç__ç´_ç___ÛÅ_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_è_Ç__Ò_ãÙè_äŒÑÉè_ä_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö___Ô_ÅøçùÁçÏÊ_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_ŒÅ´Œ_áçÑÉ_â£_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_Œ ÉŒö __Î__÷ç¥´_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_çÓÙŒÔ__ùÄ•_öèÀª_Ä¬Œö _Û_èÀà_üÜ_É¢_Û__øÕèçøèçøçä©Œè_Œ_Ñ___Œö_•_ä‹Ûâ  __â_ÜÂèµá_ù´Œ¡±_÷ø•__èãÔ___Œ___ù_Œ¨ÎŒÉ¬èÄ____Œö____ç_ãŒ__èãÔ•_ÎèÛÎ_÷ø_Îà_üÒ_ü_‹ÛÅç___Û_‹ÛÅçÊÓç©____ç_ãŒ__èãÔ_ÛùçÈ«Œ_¢_öê‹ÛÅŒÀÄçê _«ÈŒ_¬è_ãŒ_Üç_ã___•_ÎŒÉ_çÈãçÈàç_¡èãÔ___çÈãçÈà‹ÛâçÓ±Œ__Œ¨_Œ¨äŒÉ¬_Ä¬çä_Œá´Œ_¥Œê__Òç___•_ÎŒÏ¡___Œ¨äŒÉ¬Œ±Û_ÉçŒêö•_Î_ê___È___ç_ã_ÊüŒÀÄ_äÜ_¨µ_÷øŒö©çÓ¬è__ŒøÙè_Ç_È__üÔŒÎ_ŒèÑŒ¨____çÉ_Œ_¬ç_____Œ__çÇÜ___è_ ŒöÅ_____¨è_±ç_äèÀÇŒ¨_•_ÎŒ_Ê_ü___Ñ_ü_ŒÏ¬_´¨_£Ù_àÎ_Ó_ç_¨_É¢_Û__øÕèçø_¨ÜŒ¨_•_ÎŒêÎ_Ñ__ÉçŒêö24Œ¡è_Ñ_ŒÉ¬_____çç_Ô___ç_ãèøÈŒÀÄ_Ïø•_Î_¥À_ÏÙ__ÏçÓ¬Œø_èà«ŒèÑŒ¨____è¢Çç__ç´_çÑÉ‹ÛÅ__Ô_ÄÅ‹ÛÅèà»_ùÛ‹ÛÅçÑÉ__È‹ÛÅçªÎ__È•_ÎçÓ_èà_ŒçÅ_ù´Œ_«ŒÉ¬Œ¨_Œ_Ê_É¢_Û__øÕèçø_¨ÜŒ¨_èÛÎ_ª çÈ___È__Áç_ã_Åê_Û__üÜŒÏ_‹Ûâ  _È_Œ_©•_Î_öÔŒÅ__ü__üÛŒêç__â_Ñ_èÀ÷_«ÈçùÛç_ã_ü_Œ__èãÔ___ŒèÑŒ¨_èÛÉ•_ÎŒêÔ__ÙŒ__ç_ãç__Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏŒÕÎ____¡Ôèøá_ãÀ•__è¡«è«£_¥__ÀÄ_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏçÇÜŒç_ŒÅÏ__¢Œ__ŒÉÂŒ_ÛèÀª_üÛŒü__ÏäŒèç___ç±È_Û_è«¬ç_ãç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î_«ÈŒ_¬•_öèãÔ___Œ¨__»Î•_ä‹Ûâ  Œ_â___çä__ùÄ‹ÛÅ_÷«__Ñ‹ÛÅ_¨ÜŒÀç‹ÛÅ_Åê_Û_ç_ãç_÷Œø _ê___È____äÜ_¨µŒÏ¬_ÀÁ_ÅøŒèÔè__ç_ã_È_Œ_©_Ä__è__Ï__üçŒ_Û•_ÎèÀª_÷øŒø_ŒÉ¬__Ò_ü_Œ______¡Ô•_Î__Ù_÷øŒø__ü_ç¥Î__£__ä____¡Ôç_ãŒÉÂçã___¨è_±ŒÕÎ_ÎÔèÁÉ‹Ûâ  chinaç_Üçã¡  blog•__http://www.1339624141.tumblr.com	100000	548	99452	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/chinese-government-secret-human-experiments-require-attention-worlds-people_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_Ïç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î	47	Closed	1378166764	173	26	20	11	13	5	15	157	47	5	3	7	10	5	8	6	7	3	3	2	1	6	4	5	1	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	54810891	522566696ce61c1f6700000d	petition	Including People with Disabilities: Require ADA Compliance/Accessibility as a Metric in any College Rating System	"The President‰Ûªs plan to combat the rising cost of higher education includes connecting financial aid to a school‰Ûªs performance using a number of metrics.

"Located in Waco, Texas, the Waco Mammoth Site provides a rare glimpse into the natural history of the southwest United States. It is one of the few sites where visitors can view the fossil remains of Ice Age animals lying where they died up to 70,000 years ago. Including the site as a national monument would further enhance the value of this experience.  The site already has a state-of-the-art shelter and welcome center furnished by the community of Waco and Baylor University.

"When the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934 was passed, Congress specifically authorized separate requirements for corporations, trusts, and other legal entities. The ATF seeks to disregard congressional judgment and impose burdens on all sorts of individuals associated with legal entities.  Criminals intent on obtaining access to firearms are extremely unlikely to establish a legal entity and then register the transfer of the NFA firearm with ATF and pay the $200 transfer tax, paying the higher cost for a registered firearm in the process. The ATF should be concerned with unregistered firearms not legally registered NFA items. Further, many chief law enforcement officers unjustly refuse to sign required forms for NFA paperwork.

"Haunted House Attractions are widely attended during the month of October by millions of Americans collectively generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and having a positive effect on the US economy each year.   Our mission is to establish National Haunted House Day, recognizing haunted houses and their contribution to small business, job creation and the arts.  National Haunted House Day not only recognizes this great industry but additionally serves as a conduit of fundraising for charitable projects and community foundations.  As artists, business owners, community leaders and as a united family sharing a common vision and passion for an industry, we ask that NATIONAL HAUNTED HOUSE DAY be declared by the White House and recognized each year on the SECOND FRIDAY IN OCTOBER."	100000	347	99653	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/name-second-friday-october-national-haunted-house-day	47	Closed	1379895929	48	5	28	61	32	4	17	27	15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	12	14	5	4	6	5	10	5	3	4	0	1	5	1	5	1	5	0	6	10	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	34711041	5242e2482bcfa3a86d000005	petition	Chinese government secret human experiments-----Require the attention of the world's people _ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_Ïç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î•_Îèøá_±â_ü_ç¥Î____¡ÔŒÉ___¬	_öÔ_÷ø_ü_Œ__Œ¨äŒ__ŒÉÂ_¡Ôç_Üçã¡•_Î_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏŒÉ_Œ_«_ù´Œø__öÔŒÎÉ_ÜÂ_É¢_Û__øÕèçøŒÏ¬Œ Éç_ãç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î_«ÈŒ_¬Œø_èà«_öÔ_üäŒçÅŒ_Å_üçŒö¡Œ¡±è¢Ç_¨ÜŒ¨__öêèâùçÁÂŒÎ_Œ__ŒèÔèÄ Œ__çâ_•_ÎçÁ¨èø_ç_ãŒ_¬èãäçÁÂŒÎ_‹ÛÅ_Ç÷èÁÛŒ_Ü‹ÛÅŒÀÄèãèçÑÉ•_ÎŒ___üÓ_Ïäç__Œ¡ÀçÑÉ•_Î7Œ_ÅŒ´_ŒãÀç_Ü_Â£çùÀ__Ù_Ïäè¢ÇŒ¨__»ÎèÀ_è±Á•_ÎŒ_Ê___èøá_±â__ÙŒ__ç_ãç__Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏŒÕÎ____¡ÔŒÉ___¬  Œø__öÔèÀ_èÁÎç_ãç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î_«ÈŒ_¬ŒÏ¬_ü_Œ__ŒèÇèãÔ___(ç__ç´____Œö_)Œ¨__»Î•_ÎçÓ±Œ__Œ¨_Œ¨äŒÉ¬_Ä¬è«Ùè«£•_ÎŒÏ¬_ü_Œ___ÏäŒ___àè_ÑÊè_ÏŒêÎèÄ__¨Ü__È______•_ÎŒÉüŒ_Üç_ã_Ïä•__ç_èŒÈ_Œê«Œá_Œ_ç•_ÎŒ´_•_Î28Œ_Å•_ÎŒèÑŒ¨_3Œ_«•_Î_¨ÜŒ¨__öêŒ_êŒ¨ÇèâÎç÷_ç_ä_üçŒÊ»__÷ç£¬èÛÎèà»_ùÛ•_____ŒÎÑŒ__ŒÉÂ___•_ÎçÓá•_Î40Œ_Å•_ÎŒèÑŒ¨_10Œ_«•_Î_¨ÜŒ¨___È___èÄ Œ__Œ£_èÉ_çªÎ  ŒÉ_èãÔ___çÏÙç_ü_÷ø•__Œö____èãÔçÓµèãÔ_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö__ÀÁ_Åø_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_èö è¨__ùÄ‹ÛÅç_©__¥Œ_Ü_ùÄ•_ö_ù___¥•_ä  çä_ŒöÇŒ__è¡Äç_ã_÷øŒö____èãÔ_ùÄ•_ÎŒèøŒö _ü_•__Œö__ÄÉçÈ»_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_ŒÀÄçê _ÛùçÈ«_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_èãÔŒ_±ŒÄè_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö__ÛùçÈ«_¬ÁŒ_èŒ_¢_öê_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_è¨¡ŒÀ Œö __ê_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_çÓÙŒ_÷èÄ_Œ___ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_____Ê_Œ¡__ü´_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_ç________Œ_Û_ùÄ•_öèÀª_Ä¬Œö _Û_èÀàçÉ_Œ_¬ç_____èÀÇŒ¨_Œè_Œ_Ñ___Œö_•_ä•__Œö_ç__ç´_ç___ÛÅ_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_è_Ç__Ò_ãÙè_äŒÑÉè_ä_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö___Ô_ÅøçùÁçÏÊ_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_ŒÅ´Œ_áçÑÉ_â£_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_Œ ÉŒö __Î__÷ç¥´_ùÄ‹ÛÅŒö_çÓÙŒÔ__ùÄ•_öèÀª_Ä¬Œö _Û_èÀà_É¢_Û__øÕèçøèçøçä©Œè_Œ_Ñ___Œö_•_ä  __â_ÜÂèµá_ù´Œ¡±_÷ø•__èãÔ___Œ___ù_Œ¨ÎŒÉ¬èÄ____Œö____ç_ãŒ__èãÔ•_ÎèÛÎ_÷ø_Îà_üÒ_ü_‹ÛÅç___Û_‹ÛÅçÊÓç©____ç_ãŒ__èãÔ_ÛùçÈ«Œ_¢_öê‹ÛÅŒÀÄçê _«ÈŒ_¬è_ãŒ_Üç_ã___•_ÎŒÉ_çÈãçÈàç_¡èãÔ___çÈãçÈà‹ÛâçÓ±Œ__Œ¨_Œ¨äŒÉ¬_Ä¬çä_Œá´Œ_¥Œê__Òç___•_ÎŒÏ¡___Œ¨äŒÉ¬Œ±Û_ÉçŒêö•_Î_ê___È___ç_ã_ÊüŒÀÄ_äÜ_¨µ_÷øŒö©çÓ¬è__ŒøÙè_Ç_È__üÔŒÎ_ŒèÑŒ¨____çÉ_Œ_¬ç_____Œ__çÇÜ___è_ ŒöÅ_____¨è_±ç_äèÀÇŒ¨_•_ÎŒ_Ê_ü___Ñ_ü_ŒÏ¬_´¨_£Ù_àÎ_Ó_ç_¨_É¢_Û__øÕèçø_¨ÜŒ¨_•_ÎŒêÎ_Ñ__ÉçŒêö24Œ¡è_Ñ_çÇÜ__Òç_Ô___ç_ãèøÈŒÀÄ_Ïø•_Î_¥À_ÏÙ__ÏçÓ¬Œø_èà«ŒèÑŒ¨____è¢Çç__ç´_çÑÉ‹ÛÅ__Ô_ÄÅ‹ÛÅèà»_ùÛ‹ÛÅçÑÉ__È‹ÛÅçªÎ__È•_ÎçÓ_èà_ŒçÅ_ù´Œ_«ŒÉ¬Œ¨_Œ_Ê_É¢_Û__øÕèçø_¨ÜŒ¨_èÛÎ_ª çÈ___È__Áç_ã_Åê_Û__üÜŒÏ_  _È_Œ_©•_Î_öÔŒÅ__ü__üÛŒêç__â_Ñ_èÀ÷_«ÈçùÛç_ã_ü_Œ__èãÔ___ŒèÑŒ¨_èÛÉ•_ÎŒêÔ__ÙŒ__ç_ãç__Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏŒÕÎ____¡Ôèøá_ãÀ•__è¡«è«£_¥__ÀÄ_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_ÏçÇÜŒç_ŒÅÏ__¢Œ__ŒÉÂŒ_ÛèÀª_üÛŒü__ÏäŒèç___ç±È_Û_è«¬ç_ãç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î_«ÈŒ_¬•_öèãÔ___Œ¨__»Î•_ä  Œ_â___çä__ùÄ_÷«__Ñ‹ÛÅ_¨ÜŒÀç_Åê_Û_ç_ãç_÷Œø _ê___È____äÜ_¨µŒÏ¬_ÀÁ_ÅøŒèÔè__ç_ã_È_Œ_©_Ä__è__Ï__üçŒ_Û•_ÎèÀª_÷øŒø_ŒÉ¬__Ò_ü_Œ______¡Ô•_Î__Ù_÷øŒø__ü_ç¥Î__£__ä____¡Ôç_ãŒÉÂçã___¨è_±ŒÕÎ_ÎÔèÁÉ  chinaç_Üçã¡ Œç_Œ¨¢•__http://www.1339624141.tumblr.com	100000	259	99741	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/chinese-government-secret-human-experiments-require-attention-worlds-people-_ü_Œ___ÓÀŒ_Ïç_÷Œø _____ÒŒ¨__»Î	47	Closed	1380115613	152	19	5	3	5	9	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	12	8	10	6	2	2	1	0	1	0	3	0	3	1	2	3	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	25911046	524317402f2c88446800000d	petition	name the dark blue/light blue 2 tone ribbon with the water droplet as the official Hydrocephalus awareness ribbon!

"The Olympic Animal Sanctuary in Washington State is nothing more than a concentration camp for about 160 dogs that have been locked up in cages with no heat or AC, fed every other day, little water and no freedom for many years. The stench and the constant crying from these animals has been reported over and over to the police in Forks, WA with absolutely no investigation and no cooperation. Dogs are living in filthy conditions. Agencies have been contacted by neighbors, Facebook animal advocates and many others. No one listens and no one does a thing.

Petition to retroactively abrogate the two illegal elections of Barack H. Obama to the presidency of the U.S.A. on the basis that the man fraudulently represented himself as constitutionally eligible to be president while knowingly not so. Mr. Obama/Soetoro publicized himself as having been born in what is now called Kenya for over 16 years through his literary agent before being illegally elected to the presidency. His illegal and illegitimate administration has published a fraudulent electronic file on the official White House website as purported authentication of his constitutional eligibility to be president. The electronic file that he claims is a true representation of his original birth certificate is a proven manufactured forgery as is his Selective Service Registration card.	100000	509	99491	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/petition-retroactively-abrogate-illegal-elections-constitutionally-ineligible-individual	30	Closed	1386807432	111	21	3	27	45	47	39	44	32	12	9	14	8	1	11	10	12	11	4	6	4	5	8	3	3	3	4	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	50911576	52a91fe96ce61c7d01000005	petition	"The People of Ukraine demand Referendum on IMMEDIATE DISSMISSAL of the discredited President, Government and Parliament"	"The only Constitutional way out of the situation is NATIONAL REFERENDUM.

"Dear Mr. President, Please display a gold ribbon and or light the White House gold in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Childhood cancer is the number one killer by disease of our nation‰Ûªs children. Seven children die each day in our country from cancer and another thirty six are newly diagnosed. Childhood cancer kills more children than AIDS, asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis and congenital anomalies combined. A display of gold on the White House in September will demonstrate to the tens of thousands of children currently undergoing treatments and the many thousands of families who have lost children to cancer that you consider the elimination of childhood cancer to be a national priority.

Stop SeaWorld and those alike.	"In the early 1990's, the U.K. shut down marine parks with captive dolphins and whales on display. Why did they do this and why should the U.S. do the same?  -These animals do not enjoy performing.  -Dolphins and whales in captivity live shorter lives in captivity. Anti-depressants are sometimes administered.  -They are highly intelligent, family oriented creatures and placing them in captivity cuts them off from their family group.  -A cage in captivity is never a healthy enough space than the ocean.  -To engage and educate the public, most surveys say people would be more interested in observing them in the wild than in a tank.  Sign this petition and let your voice be heard to shut down SeaWorld and those alike that hold dolphins and whales in captivity.

An appeals court ruled against net neutrality. Net neutrality protects the consumers against their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in an unequal marketplace.  This ruling means that ISPs can discriminate against or even block which websites and services they provide. For example, if Comcast feels like Netflix is competing against its own video service, they can choose to require Netflix to pay a premium fee for consumers to access it or even block it entirely.

"The United States is considering signing the expanded Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which would include, and ultimately benefit, Japan.  Every year, Japanese ""fishermen"" engage in a cruel and inhuman dolphin hunt in the cove of Taiji, in which hundreds of dolphins are brutally killed or captured for a life of misery and slavery in captivity, for financial exploitation.  Dolphins are known to be highly intelligent sentient beings, capable of emotions, social bonding, and complex problem-solving and communication, and should thus be unconditionally protected.

President Obama should share a progress report on his climate action plan and efforts to protect America's Great Outdoors, and invite Pope Francis to visit one of America's national parks and monuments."	100000	1305	98695	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/speak-pope-francis-about-protecting-gods-creation	30	Closed	1393990312	6	12	28	5	2	28	12	220	51	55	33	22	43	47	112	220	225	45	24	32	22	19	11	12	4	5	3	1	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	130513051	53168feb2bcfa3645600000e	petition	__Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ____Á_Ïä____ùÄ•_Å__Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ__Œèü__¥_üçŒÉÂ•_Å__Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ__è«»_±ÁèÉêè«´•_Å Please do not delete this petition! èøá_üçè_ÅŒöÊ_ª_èÀª_ü»èøá_ãÀ•_Å	"     _öÔè_Å_ü__öÔŒ_ÙŒ_Ùèøá_ãÀ•____Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ_____ŒçÑç___÷___÷èÀê__ Œ_¢_¢ Œø_Œá¬_¢ùè«»_±Á‹ÛÅ_Â_Œ_ÜŒ_±Œ_ÀŒ__Œ_¬èÛÉ•____Ñè¨¨___ŒçÑç___÷_Œüâ_ÈÔŒÀÄ__¥Œ¨÷__ä__¥Œö__Áö!     _öÔŒ_ÙŒÏ¬ç___÷___÷èÀêŒá´__Ï21Œ_«__ ‹Ûâ2007Œ_«Œ_ÛŒ_ÜŒÉÂŒèü_ÑÊçê ŒÉÜ_ä£_öÔŒ_ÙŒá´èµã•_ÎŒÉÂŒèü_Û_èÀÇ1ŒçÄŒ__ŒÔ÷Œá´ç__ç©_çª_Œ__Œ_¬ŒêöŒêÎ,_öÔŒ_ÙŒè»Œ_ÑŒÏ¬2011Œ_«10_ÏöŒö¡ç___÷_èµÇŒ±±ŒÎ___¥_ª¢‹ÛÅç___÷__ü_ç____¥_ª¢èµáèøäŒÉÂŒèü‹Ûâ     2012Œ_«2_Ïöèøäè¨__ÏÙ_Ñ«•_ÎŒÉÂŒèü_çè_ÛÊ_öÔŒ_Ù_ÑáŒá´13Œ_©ç_ãç_»Œêç_ù___¥Œ_Û_ª__È_‹Ûâ2013Œ_«6_Ïö_öÔŒ_Ù_ä_ŒÉÂŒèü_¢ Œø_ŒçèŒ¥ •_ÎŒÉÂŒèü_ÀùŒ¨äŒø__öÔŒ_ÙèÀ_èÁÎ___è_Ç_ÓÈŒàÈ•_Î_öÔŒ_Ùè¢ÇèÀÇŒ¨__öê_ü´_àçŒÀ__ÄÅçÑà‹Ûâ     ç___÷___÷èÀê_¢ Œø__ÏäŒê_Œè¡_Ïä_Àù______ŒÏ¬ç___÷_Œüâ_ÑÊ__¥_ÑÊŒ_©•_Î05Œ_«_Ó_Œö__Ñ_ŒÉÂŒèü_¢ Œø_èà»Œç_èà»__¡è«»_±ÁŒ___Ïäèµã___4.8__ÀŒÅ_5ŒçÄ_üàè«±Œç_!__µŒê_Œ__Œ_¬èÛÉèÁÛ_±Ñ_Õ±•__ç___÷___÷èÀê__Å_ü___¬Œ Îèµã__ª•__èÔ£__Ü_¥À_Ä_èáÄ_÷_2006Œ_«ŒÉ´èâÁ184_üà•_Î2010Œ_«ŒÉ´èâÁ_àÔçÎ_Œ¢_èà_4000_üà•_Î_ÛÈçÈèçê __àŒ_©ç_ø2006Œ_«ŒÉ´èâÁ184_üà•_Î2010Œ_«ŒÉ´èâÁ_àÔè__Œö¡1744_üà•_Å2008Œ_«_üÛ2011Œ_«_öÔŒ_Ù_ü_ŒÉÂŒèüŒÅ_Œö¡èê´_Ó__Â_762680ŒÉÄ•__2009Œ_«7_Ïö‰ÛÓ2012Œ_«2_Ïö32_ü»_Ïö_öÔŒ_ÙŒÏ¬__¥Œ¨_ŒÅà_Ñ´‹ÛÅ_ù___¥Œ¨_ŒÅà_Ñ´‹ÛÅŒ_«__ÔŒÅàŒ_Êçè_ŒÉ±è¨Á311Œ_©•_Î32_ü»_Ïö_àÎ_öÔŒ_ÙŒè»_¢ Œö¡15955ŒÉÄŒá´èµã•_ÎŒ__Œùà400ŒÉÄ/_Ïö‹Ûâ      ç___÷__ü_ç____¥_ª¢Œ_êŒÉäè_ä__¥Œ¨÷•_ö2013ç____¥_¡ÔŒ çŒ_ÑçÂÂ8Œèá•_ä‹ÛÅŒ_èèÒä__¥Œ¨÷•_ö2012ç____¥_¡ÔçÈöŒ_ÑçÂÂ327Œèá•_äŒÕÎèµÇŒ±±ŒÎ___¥_ª¢Œèü_©Â_É___¥Œ¨÷•_ö2011ç__èµÇ_¡ÔŒöùŒ_ÑçÂÂ1573Œèá•_ä__ä__¥Œö_Œ _•__Œè»Œö_Œ _ŒÉÂŒèüèÁ´ŒÅÀ_öÔŒ_Ù1_üà__ªŒÉÄ•_Î•_ö32_ü»_Ïö_Îä800ŒÉÄ/_ÏöèÁ´ŒÅÀ•_ä•_Î__¥_ª¢__Á_Ïä__ù__¥Œö_Œ _ŒÉÂŒèüèµÓŒÅÀ_öÔŒ_ÙŒ_ÓŒ_ÑŒá´èµã‹ÛÅŒ_Êçè_è«_ŒÕÎèµÓŒÅÀ_àÔ;__Á_Ïä__ù__¥Œö_Œ _ŒÉÂŒèüèáÙ_öÔŒ_Ùç__è¨¢_ÑÊŒ__Œ¨__ÏÙ_ªêŒ__Œ_¬ŒêöŒêÎ•____¥_ª¢Œö©çÓ¬ŒÉÂèøÅ___ç_ãèÁÎ_ü_ŒÉÂèøÅ_È£__À__ÜŒ¨_ŒÉÂèøÅ_ù___¥Œ_Û_ª__öÔŒ_Ù‹Ûâ__¥_ª¢__»_____¥Œ_Ü_ùÁ__àŒÕÎ__ÜŒ¨_•_ÎèÀùŒèçŒ__Œ_¬__äè¨¨_È_è£ÅŒäçç_¨ç¬ÜŒ_è•_ÎŒ¡ Œ_ÉèøÅ__ÜŒ¨_•_ö_ÑáŒá´13Œ_©•_äŒÕÎŒ_ÉŒ __Áö_È_•_ö_ù___¥Œ_Û_ª_•_ä_èêŒäçŒèü__¥è¨_Œ¨_•_Î__¥_ª¢Œø__öÔŒ_Ùç_ãèøÅ_ç¨ŒÉ¬_Ä¬Œê_è¨_•_Îè¢ÇèµáèøäŒÉÂŒèüŒÅ_ç_ãŒÅàèøÅ‹ÛÅ__»èøÅ_üÛ__âè¨_Œèø‹Ûâ     Œ__Œ_¬èÛÉŒ_Ñ_üçŒö¡__¥Œ_Ü_Àù___•_Î_±âŒ_©_ÑÊ_Ñ¬•_Îè¡ÅèÄ_èÀ÷çÈªŒ__Œ_¬èÛÉŒÅ____ç_ãŒ¡__ü´ŒÕÎŒ_Ó_Ïäç_ãçÓÙ_«È•_Ù +6594536504"	100000	174	99826	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/__Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ____Á_Ïä____ùÄ•_Å__Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ__Œèü__¥_üçŒÉÂ•_Å__Ñè¨¨_ü_Œ__è«»_±ÁèÉêè«´•_Å-please-do-not-delete-petition-èøá_üçè_ÅŒöÊ_ª_èÀª_ü»èøá_ãÀ•_Å	30	Closed	1393989522	174	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	17413056	53173c662f2c88080c00000b	petition	Encourage a better national work ethic by creating a Department of Work focused on inspiring people (cabinet-level).

Universal mental health screening for every pregnant and postpartum woman."	"Suicide is a leading cause of death for women during the first year after childbirth. 1 in 7 women will experience a mood or anxiety disorder during pregnancy or postpartum, yet nearly 50% remain untreated. In pregnancy, maternal mental illness negatively effects fetal development, and leads to adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and premature delivery. Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) can impair infant and early childhood cognitive and emotional development. Despite overwhelming empirical evidence, there is no universal mandate for care providers to screen pregnant and postpartum women for depression, anxiety, or family history of mental illness--a well established risk factor. Screen every mother, every time to prevent and treat perinatal mental illness.

If this disease is recognized as disabling, then a surgical diagnosis combined with records of symptoms can help many women get the help they need to simply survive as they cope.

"Since February 2014, students from Venezuelan universities have been protesting high inflation rates, food shortages, high crime rates, and human rights abuses, a consequence of a country oppressed by a regime where there is no separation of powers and no accountability. Maduro‰Ûªs disproportionate response--beating, jailing, torturing and killing-- is being overlooked by the world as media outlets have been censored.  We appreciate the swift response that the US Congress have taken through legislation.  However, it is not enough. Maduro‰Ûªs regime continues its heinous attacks against Venezuelans. We ask that stiff sanctions be enacted against human rights violators in Venezuela and that H.R.4229 be enacted when it comes to President‰Ûªs Obama‰Ûªs desk for signature.

"The Department of Justice reports that 98% of all burglar alarm activations are falsely triggered, and that police responses to false alarms cost taxpayers at least $1.8 billion each year.  With security companies' reliance on local police responses to their alarms, regardless of whether or not you have a security system in your home or business, every American ends up funding them. Given the reported 98% unreliability, this amounts to a massive misappropriation of US tax dollars.  U.S. cities who enact laws that require security companies to verify an alarm prior to police dispatch significantly lower false alarm rates and save millions of dollars.

The final tally of 7,000 oiled birds after the BP spill was a woefully inaccurate undercount."	100000	1840	98160	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/count-all-documented-oiled-wildlife-rather-just-oiled-animals-are-physically-retrieved	30	Closed	1395849624	350	325	196	99	68	75	75	58	46	24	38	21	26	21	17	16	20	16	7	6	7	26	10	12	7	5	46	45	68	110	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	184013446	5333546fa9a0b16b22000005	petition	Repeal the amendment to the Endangered Species Act (ESA)	"A bill recently introduced into the Senate and the House of Representatives would, in ReWild's analysis, add insurmountable hurdles to protecting new species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as well as mandating significant government handouts to private developers.

"The FDA has taken upon itself to potentially regulate the relationship between the Farmer and the Brewer. Farmers have relied upon the feed from WBG or wet brewers gains as livestock food and nutrient rich fertilizer for centuries. Without the beneficial exchange between the farmers and the brewing community, many jobs would be lost due to high FDA regulation costs. It is not within our best interest as craft drinking/ brewing communities to allow this eventually harmful regulation to move forward. The impact alone to the economy and environment should seriously be considered. Spent Grains from brewers and distillers are fed to farm based livestock often for no cost. Thus, resulting in very limited ecological impact.

For every 1 case reported to authorities, 24 cases go unreported.The Elder Justice Act, passed in 2010, calls for funding Adult Protective Services (APS), the only statutorily authorized agency to protect older adults who are abused. APS programs lack funding as well as reliable information and guidance on conducting case investigations, and for staffing and managing APS programs. There is a dearth in the area of elder abuse research with virtually no information about victims or perpetrators, as well as no evidence-based practices. The President's FY 2015 budget calls for initial funding to help solve these issues and we encourage him to make Elder Justice a priority because everyone should be able to age with dignity.

The training is extensive, yet the risk of injury is still there whether it's from a raging fire, an active shooter, or a multi-car accident in a blizzard. The families of those who gave their lives in the line of duty and those who protect our lives deserve our thank you's and prayers.

Mr. Bundy has exhausted years and years of due process, and continues not only to disregard US law, but also does not recognize the legitimacy of the United States government.

One of the most effective tactics of an invading military is to inhibit the flow of information in a population; this includes which information is shared and by who.

While some EDS patients function well, others are extremely debilitated by the condition. In addition to causing extreme chronic pain due to joint hypermobility, it can also significantly negatively impact circulation, digestion, the skin, the reproductive organs, the heart, and so much more doctors are only beginning to understand.  Most EDS patients' disability claims are denied multiple times over a period of 2 or 3 years, and they often have to hire a lawyer.

Not only is this a conflict of interest, Wheeler has repeatedly demonstrated that he is not working for the good of the American people.  Twice the FCC has sued internet providers over Net Neutrality issues and lost because the companies they sued were classified under Title I of the Telecommunications Act (as of 2002), and therefore cannot be regulated with regards to Net Neutrality.  Reclassifying ISPs under Title II would allow the FCC to enforce Net Neutrality rules, and in both court cases, judges recommended this course of action. The paperwork is simple, but Tom Wheeler bloviates around the issue.

As such, the Obama Administration should support Kurdish Independence for the betterment of the region and the world."	100000	106908	0	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/support-kurdish-independence	30	Under Review	1406170586	1	3	50	15805	15677	9535	8933	7347	5323	5445	6159	4788	4550	3031	2507	3632	3787	5019	1809	723	436	207	127	132	148	97	87	90	74	60	40	23	23	30	17	27	10	9	8	14	12	15	13	11	7	9	10	7	9	4	9	6	7	5	7	1	5	10	7	9	2	10594614996	53d136e36ce61c013e000000	petition	Please call Democratic Republic of Congo President Kabila to End the Suspension on Adoptions!	"Last week, 167 Members of Congress wrote President Obama asking him to directly engage President Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and resolve the crisis created by DRC‰Ûªs suspension of Exit Permits for legally adopted children.

Nearly 800 more stuck children are counting on us.

"The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) requires foster care agencies seek to terminate parental rights when a child has been in foster care for 15 out of the most recent 22 months, so that children can be freed for adoption in a timely manner.  ASFA is often ignored by both agencies and local courts, leaving children in foster care and without a permanent family to provide love, care, and security. 27% of children (more than 100,000 each year) remain in care more than 24 months, in part due to loopholes. For example, children in kinship care can remain foster children their entire lives.   We ask that the existing ASFA law be enforced, with penalties applied when the law is ignored, and that the loopholes be further restricted to free children for adoption when parents fail them."	100000	1615	98385	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/encourage-timely-permanence-children-foster-care-enforcing-adoption-and-safe-families-act	30	Closed	1412522477	198	322	175	140	213	106	60	30	31	39	17	16	15	2	8	20	5	24	92	32	9	18	6	6	8	5	10	5	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	161516001	5431a2ef7043018d6d000003	petition	Put Cancer ribbons on the White House for every month and not just Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

"The department has proposed that beginning Nov. 1, employees on government travel to one location for more than 30 days receive a flat per diem rate. For each full day during long-term TDY of 31 to 180 days, the rate would be 75 percent of the locality rate (lodging plus meals and incidentals); for travel lasting more than 180 days, it would fall to 55 percent of the locality rate for each full day. Additionally incidental travel expenses have already been expanded further burdening the government worker. This will inevitably lower morale and decrease voluntary travel to support the war fighter. Government workers have families and loved ones that they support and leave during the expected and necessary times of travel and should not be incurring additional expenditures for that support.

"All over the country, innocent men and women are being murdered by police, a predominant number of whom are black. And every time, police walk free, many without even a trial or even a punishment. This is because the police departments claim a different set of events than eyewitnesses and say that other evidence is false.  This petition is to force all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras. These cameras need to be on at all times while the officers are on duty, and the videos need to be publicly available when officers shoot or otherwise seriously harm someone. If no video is available, the officer needs to be charged with the appropriate crime, assault or murder.

"Jessica Chambers was 19 years old who was brutally burned alive on December 6,2014 in Courtland, Mississippi. She was found next to her vehicle and later passed away on December 7. 98% of her body was burned.  The investigation was not cared for in the right manner.  The district attorney has made a statement that he did not expect any arrests. It has been over a month and his statement now seems correct.  Jessica's mother has pleaded for answers and has stated that Jessica will not rest until this case is solved.  Is this corruption, gang violence, or a hate crime?

These rising costs are causing more students than ever to resort to loans if they don‰Ûªt have savings.

"HONOR Brandon Stanton for the cultural and philanthropic work with his online community called Humans of New York. He has nearly 12 million followers around the world and has told the American and immigrant story like no other.  He has also created real change.  In a recent chance encounter, he featured a local student in one of the toughest neighborhoods in America.  He followed the student's story all the way to his school and principal.  After that meeting, he set up a fundraiser for the school and in only a matter of days over $1 Million was raised - all because of the work he does and the passion he has discovered with his community - and it's still ongoing! Last year, he took a 50 day trip in partnership with the UN, and brought his millions of followers together in a different way."	100000	363	99637	https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/recognize-brandon-stanton-creator-hony-humans-new-york-his-humanitarian-and-cultural-efforts	30	Closed	1422553929	87	8	2	2	31	121	44	18	17	10	8	5	0	0	3	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	36317621	54caea6500e579a73c000000	petition	"Let There Be, in 2015, an Awareness Day for DIPG!

It said that the decision to prosecute Anwar and the conduct of his trial raised serious concerns about the rule of law and the fairness of the judicial system in Malaysia.

In this economy young people need a quality college education to be able to compete in the current job market.  Therefore student loans are a cost of doing business in the US and should be paid out of their gross income rather than their net income just like any other business expense.

"Scientology received tax exempt status in 1993 through the use of numerous frivolous lawsuits and blackmail against government officials. Please tell the IRS to retract COS tax exempt status. They are estimated to have made billions of dollars since the illegal 1993 agreement. The money is used to harass former members, coerce abortions, to secure their Int. base so people can‰Ûªt escape, child abuse, forcing members to disconnect from family who aren‰Ûªt Scientologist friendly, and to litigate to death anyone who opposes them. They litigated the ‰ÛÏCult Awareness Network‰Ûù to death years ago and then bought the name. The C.A.N is now a Scientology run enterprise.

"Over 10 years ago, the CDC released findings from the ACE study that 1:4 girls and 1:6 boys are estimated to experience sexual abuse in our country.  Since then, awareness and support for prevention efforts are still nowhere at the level they need to be, considering the hundreds of thousands of children estimated to be affected by this devastating crime.   It is time child sexual abuse is granted the recognition and attention it deserves. The Mama Bear Effect, a 501(c)(3) organization has trademarked a chartreuse awareness ribbon for this cause, and we are seeking the president's approval and adoption of this ribbon to represent this worthy cause.
